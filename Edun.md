# Path to the left
I’d choose the **path to the left**. It leads into a dense forest where the light is dim, adding an element of mystery and intrigue. Exploring the forest could reveal hidden secrets or interesting 

encounters, making it a more engaging choice for the story. Plus, dense forests are often rich with potential for unexpected events and discoveries!

# Do not stay Wwere you are

You decide to remain still, watching the strange light from a distance. Time passes, but nothing happens. The forest around you grows colder, and you start to feel uneasy.

You wait longer, but there's no change.

Suddenly, everything goes quiet. No birds, no wind—just silence. You feel a deep sense of regret for not taking action.

The adventure ends here.

Would you like to start over and make a different choice?
